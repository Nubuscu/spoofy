# spoofy

## What is it?
A spotify companion app that shows some listening metrics and related bands.

## Why?
Spoofy was created for some coursework, hence has some 'design decisions' to meet certain criteria and missing features where there was
no incentive to implement

## What's next and when?
* The ability to log out
* improved recommendations

Happening when I have free time. This is a side project and therefore is lower on the priorities now.
The recommendations were intended to be part of another project (making an API for it to call) 
which also may-or-may-not happen as and when I have time.
